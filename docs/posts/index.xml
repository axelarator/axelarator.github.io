          Authenticode Signature #  The point of code signing certificates is to verify the file came from a trusted source, the file was not tampered with prior to receiving it, and the file’s origin can be validated. Code signing creates a hash of the code and encrypts it with a private key adding its signature. During execution, this signature is validated and if the hash matches, it gives assurance that the code has not been modified.

          Identify the cloud perimeter of a target. Thanks to colleagues who are smarter than me.
Identify Service #   Use OSINT to determine the provider and region your target is located in.  Shodan for example has a cloud.region filter that lists what region the IP is located in. Some examples:  GCP: us-central1 Azure: northeurope AWS: us-east-1     Download corresponding IP ranges based on your target’s provider.

      <title>Malware Analysis Homelab</title>

          This guide will serve as a lab for both static and dynamic malware analysis. The dynamic analysis portion will be in its own network that cannot reach out to the host network and vice versa.
I have to give credit to c3rb3ru5 because her guide is what taught me about being able to create networks within virtual machines and setting up mitmproxy to capture traffic.
It was inspired by her KVM Malware Lab Guide but I had to make some changes due to issues on my end.

      <title>Event Triggered Execution: Unix Shell Configuration Modification (T1546.004)</title>

          Event Triggered Execution: Unix Shell Configuration Modification #  T1546.004
Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell. User Unix Shells execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (/etc) and the user’s home directory (~/) to configure the environment.

      <title>Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell (T1059.004)</title>

          Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell #  T1059.004
Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads. Interactive shells may be accessed through command and control channels or during lateral movement such as with SSH. Adversaries may also leverage shell scripts to deliver and execute multiple commands on victims or as part of payloads used for persistence.
Invocation #  Interactive Shell #  An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments and without the -c option whose standard input and error are both connected to terminals (as determined by isatty), or one started with the -i option.

      <title>Hide Artifacts: NTFS File Attributes (T1564.004)</title>

          Hide Artifacts: NTFS File Attributes #  T1564.004
Data or executables may be stored in New Technology File System (NTFS) partition metadata instead of directly in files. This may be done to evade some defenses, such as static indicator scanning tools and anti-virus.
Adversaries may use NTFS file attributes to hide their malicious data in order to evade detection. Every New Technology File System (NTFS) formatted partition contains a Master File Table (MFT) that maintains a record for every file/directory on the partition.

EC2 Instance running Ubuntu Server 18.04 w/ Docker running an Alpine Linux container.
 Port 22 is locked to my IP only Port 2375 is exposed which is the Docker API. Useful for tools like Portainer.  Got an alert for a masscan command searching for port 2375. Another alert was triggered for 2376 as some APIs expose this instead of 2375.

          Executive Summary #   In mid-April 2022, Mandiant observed UNC2500 campaigns using MSI packages to distribute Qakbot payloads. This change comes shortly after Microsoft’s announcement that macros from Office documents downloaded from the internet (ZoneIdentifier ADS) will be blocked by default. This new payload uses a botnet ID AA, which is unique from previous campaigns that have used tr, cullinan, and cullinan01. Distribution came from phishing emails containing a malicious link from either OneDrive or files hosted on compromised websites that downloads a ZIP archive.
