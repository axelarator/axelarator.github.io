Welcome to my brain dump. I currently work as a CTI Tactial analyst and am using this blog as a way to publicize personal research I do whether it's work related or just for fun. Since starting my career the security industry in 2021, my Notion notebook has been filling up with anything I find interesting and serves as a reference for guides on getting started in niche areas. Rather than keeping it all private, I wanted a place to share my findings.

The blog is built using Hugo and hosted through GitHub Pages because free is the best price.
