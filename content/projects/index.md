# Gollector
[Gollector](https://github.com/axelarator/gollector) was my first real coding project and a way for me to learn Golang. It's definitely not perfect but helped automate an intelligence workflow for finding C2 beacon configs.

The goal was to practice interacting with APIs and get specific information I was looking for. I haven't worked on it in a while, but I still use the tool often for interesting IPs.
